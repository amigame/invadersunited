	h3 How do I play? 
	
	p The main objective is to survive 10 waves in the invasion and become a defender yourself. As a defender you'll have the chance to evaporate upcoming waves of invaders and achieve a high score. There's a waiting list so depending on the queue it might take a while to enter the game. You don't have to wait for your turn. Download the code and setup your own game
