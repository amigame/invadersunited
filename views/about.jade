	p <strong>Invaders United</strong> is a re-imagining of the old classic 
		a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders") Space Invaders. 
	p It features a new twist to the gameplay, giving an answer to the question:<br> <b>What would it feel like to be one of of the invaders?</b> 
	
	h3 Technology
	p Invaders United is built with new technologies like Node.js, Processing.js, Sockets.io.s Thanks for playing. It was fun creating it so we are very pleased to be releasing it for free...
	
	h3 How do I play? 
	
	p The main objective is to survive 10 waves in the invasion and become a defender yourself. As a defender you'll have the chance to evaporate upcoming waves of invaders and achieve a high score. There's a waiting list so depending on the queue it might take a while to enter the game. If you don't feel like waiting, you can start your own game. Download the code on github
