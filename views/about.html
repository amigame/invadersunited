	<h1>FAQs</h1>
	
	<h3 id="faq-1">How do I play?</h3>
	
	<p>Use your left and right arrows to move and your spacebar to shoot (you can only shoot when you are the defender). The main objective is to survive 10 waves in the invasion and become a defender yourself. As a defender you'll have the chance to evaporate upcoming waves of invaders and achieve a high score. There's a waiting list so depending on the queue it might take a while to enter the game.</p>
	
	<h3 id="faq-2">Why do you need my email?</h3>
	
	<p>It's meant to be an easy way to reward the top score with Paypal money without requiring further registration. As we have a no tolerance policy against abuse of our users privacy there is no chance we will use your email or sell it to others. In fact we are not recording any of the emails, apart from the top scores.

	<h3 id="faq-3">What are the rewards?</h3>
	
	<p>Usually it's a small money prize sent to the top score's email address using Paypal.</p>
	
	<h3 id="faq-4">When are the rewards given?</h3>
	
	<p>On occassion, when conditions seem appropriate we run a game marathon for few days grant the top score a prize at the end. Follow the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23invadersunited" target="_blank">#invadersunited</a> on Twitter for updates when's the next run.</p>
	
	<h3 id="faq-5">What if I don't want to give an email?</h3>
	
	<p>Absolutely fine. You're just giving up any chance for a reward. No Email = No Reward. Simple :)</p>
	
	<h3 id="faq-6">I want the reward but I still don't want to enter my email...</h3>
	
	<p>No problem. There are a number of services that can give you disposable emails, like <a href="http://mailinator.com/" target="_blank">mailinator.com</a>. All you need to do is attach that temporarily to your paypal account and use it in the game to achieve a top score. Fingers crossed ;)</p>
